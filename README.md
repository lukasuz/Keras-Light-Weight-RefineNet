# Keras Light-Weight RefineNet

This is a Light-Weight RefineNet implementation with ResNet as backbone for semantic segmentation. The models have been implemented with Keras. Currently only the models are provided, but in the future I am going to add everything needed for plug-and-play training (All the scripts already exist, but need a clean up).



## Credits

This implementation is a Keras version based on original work by [Nekrasov, Shen and Reid](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03272). Their Pytorch implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/DrSleep/light-weight-refinenet).  Furthermore, this implementation is heavily influenced by the original RefineNet paper by [Lin et al.](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_RefineNet_Multi-Path_Refinement_CVPR_2017_paper.html), and the RefineNet tensorflow implementation by [George Seif](https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite).



## TODO

- ~~Add models~~
- Add training script and utils
- Add generator script
